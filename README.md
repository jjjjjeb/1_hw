# Advanced Excel: Exploring Kickstarter Data

1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

## 1a 
I would recommend Kickstarter campaigns for theater, music, and film projects in that order.  These projects have higher chance of success on this platform.

## 1b
With some exceptions I would recommend against using Kickstarter for projects in journalism, food, publishing, and technology.  In general, there is a lower chance of success in these sectors. But before out ruling completely I would look into sub-categories.  For example, in food people don’t seem to want to support food trucks or restaurants, but small batch processing is highly successful.  In terms of tech, folks are not so interested in wearables or websites but are supportive of hardware development.

## 1c
Never start your Kickstarter campaign in November or December.  The data lends me to believe that these projects have to compete against the Holiday season and most often fail.

## 2
Analytics on shares and links via different social media platforms could elucidate more detailed information on pathways to success.  Analytics on campaign end states and city origin could help also forecast future campaign potential per category.  We also can’t tell here if the campaigns are started by individuals, businesses, non-profits, or partnerships.

## 3
Seeing US data in category and sub-category as compared to other countries would be interesting. Tracking campaign the end state with the number of backers could lead to some insights.
